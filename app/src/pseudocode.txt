Do the other part of the form.

When save is clicked, get all the values from all the fields of that form, then call a function with those values, create a new title and add it to the website.

Brainstorm how to store those titles so that they don't change while other states change




EducationValues is an object that has all the values of all the degrees in it, and i can iterate over it to create the sections for the education field.
Then when someone clicks one education section, i can get that id, search in the object, get the values, and put them in the form fields



Things to fix: when you press +education, fields blank, currentId = ""
when you press a section, fields should be with those values, currentId = that sections id.
